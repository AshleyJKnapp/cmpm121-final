# Devlog Entry - 11/15/2024
## Introducing the team

### Tools Lead: Nathaniel-Berl Valdenor 
This person will research alternative tools, identify good ones, and help every other team member set them up on their own machine in the best configuration for your project. This person might also establish your team’s coding style guidelines and help peers setup auto-formatting systems. This person should provide support for systems like source control and automated deployment (if appropriate to your team’s approach).

### Engine Lead: Kevin Gallegos
This person will research alternative engines, get buy-in from teammates on the choice, and teach peers how to use it if it is new to them. 
The Engine Lead should also establish standards for which kinds of code should be organized into which folders of the project. They should try to propose software designs that insulate the rest of the team from many details of the underlying engine.

## Prototyping Lead: Trish Nguyen
This person will make quick proof of concepts mechanics that will convey the idea of the final product. This might involve making small code examples outside of the main game project to teach others. This person should lead the discussion of scope and stop the team from over-reaching on aspects of the product that cannot be completed before the deadline.

### Design Lead: Ashley Knapp
This person will be responsible for setting the creative direction of the project, and establishing the look and feel of the game. They might make small art or code samples for others to help them contribute and maintain game content. Where the project might involve a domain-specific language, the Design Lead (who is still an engineer in this class) will lead the discussion as to what primitive elements the language needs to provide.

## Tools and materials

We intend to use Javscript with the Phaser library to create our game. We have decided on starting with Javascript as that is what every member has the most experience with, and from which the Phaser library has been built on. We have settled on Phaser as well because of our experience with the framework before and hope that experience will guide us when we make the transition to Typescript.

We will be using Javascript, JSON, and HTML during our development. Our game will be ran through a web browser through HTML and supported through Javascript and JSON. We decided on strating with Javascript while we have more experience in the past with Javascript and this will be a learning experience in transitioning a Javascript framework to a Javascript adjacent language(Typescript). 


We will be using Clip Studio Paint and Krita for our visual assets as they both are able to work with PSD files. We have chosen these programs as our Design Lead and Prototyping lead have expertise with each respectively and can collaborate on the work. We will all be using Visual Studio Code for writing code as well as testing through local hosting.

Our alternate platform choice will be transitioning from Javascript to Typescript. As stated before this will be an experience transitioning a Javascript framework into Typescript, a Javascript adjacent language. We have also chosen Typescript as the alternate platform choice to keep on building upon the foundation that we have started since the beginning of the school quarter.

## Outlook

We anticipate the transition between Javascript to Typescript being the hardest part of this project. This is because Phaser has been build on the Javascript language and even if we are merely moving to an adjacent language there are going to be many conflicts that we cannot overlook in order for our game to function. There will be a lot of refactoring and revision of the previously working code, perhaps even some deletions if it seems we cannot transition a mechanic in an appropiate amount of time due to the deadline.
